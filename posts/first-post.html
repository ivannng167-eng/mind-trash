      <h2>Welcome to Mind Trash</h2>
      <p>This is your first post. It's basically just some placeholder text to get things started. Feel free to replace this with your actual thoughts, musings, or "trash".</p>
      <p>Share your observations, your dreams, and those little thoughts that don't quite fit anywhere else. This is your space to explore and be as real as you want.</p>
